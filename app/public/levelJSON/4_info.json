  "storyline" : "Shortly after the night battle draws to a close, the sun begins to rise. A new day has dawned, and you hope that not many of your troops fell before they could see it.\n\nHigh General McBeige relays a status update to you. Not many have been killed, but many were injured in the night. They need rest before they will be able to fight again, so you will be fighting with reduced numbers this morning.\n\n\"Luckily, I may have found something to help us. I had the quartermaster go through the old war provisions from year ago. She found many unlabeled boxes of equipment. They are still going through most of them, but I recognized one of the things they found!\"\n\nHe shows you a small bag of what look like the barbs from barbed wire. When you look closely, they seem to sparkle with a slight blue tinge.\n\n\"These are magical caltrops developed a long time ago by one of Magus DaZel's apprentices. When this bag is thrown into the battlefield, they act as a small explosive. Then, when enemies step onto them, they are slowed down and destroyed by magical energy.\"\n\nThis should indeed prove useful. You climb the stairs and take your place at the tower overlooking the battlefield.",
