  "storyline" : "As the last of the villagers' wagons passes through the gate, you and your troops follow. Night is falling and you are exhausted, but the urgency with which Scoutmaster Tara approaches you tells you that your work is not yet done.\n\n\"My Liege, my scouts report no more refugees on either the East or West Roads. However, all of the enemies from those regions are now converging to attack the party on the North Road. They are moving to destroy the bridge over the Red River.\"\n\n\"If we do not hit them with full force, the villagers will be overrun,\" High General McBeige adds. \"We must throw everything we have at them. Few of our soldiers are left unscathed, but those that can stand are raring to fight!\"\n\nThe soldiers lined up in front of you cheer at his words. Morale is high in the face of this yet unknown threat.\n\n\"We don't know what this is yet, but we might need it,\" the High General says to you as he thrusts an odd little box into your hands. It is polished steel, but, strangely, does not seem to be openable. You resolve to throw it at the slime-beasts if all else fails.\n\nYou look to the sky and see it begin to turn purple with the setting sun. A warhorn sounds and you mount your horse.",
