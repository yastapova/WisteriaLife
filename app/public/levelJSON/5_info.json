  "storyline" : "\"Scoutmaster Tara reporting for duty, my Liege!\" Your scoutmaster approaches and she begins to urgently deliver a report.\n\n\"My scouts on all three main roads are reporting that the outlying settlements are evacuating, and the refugees are on their way to the castle as we speak. My scouts also report that the enemy is mustering to attack the roads.\"\n\nHigh General McBeige frowns as he hears this. \"They would attack civilians! The cowards! The blackguards! My Liege, we must move to protect the civilians.\"\n\nYou instruct him to dispatch several contingents of troops to each road. You will have to work fast to protect the villagers. It seems that for every one of your people that falls, an enemy springs up to take their place.",
