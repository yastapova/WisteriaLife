She tells you that all the villages they passed along the way were lifeless.\n\n\"There were no signs of battle. It was if everyone simply dropped what they were doing and left,\" she informs you. \"I visited one of those villages not a fortnight ago. If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believed it was deserted.\"\n\nShe leaves to tend to her people and assist the healers and quartermasters in managing them. In the meantime, another group is coming along the East Road, and your troops stand ready to protect them.",
