They're pushing the horses pulling their wagons as hard as they can, and you see several slime monsters in hot pursuit.\n\nHigh General McBeige leads a fresh group of soldiers out through the gates for you, and you set off toward the terrified civilians as he returns through the gates to muster the units for the next attack.",
