  "storyline" : "You and the troops follow as the refugees file through the gate. You are immediately accosted by Scoutmaster Tara.\n\n\"That was the last of the eastern settlements. My scouts report that refugees are coming down the West Road, and they are being chased by these foul creatures.\"\n\nHigh General McBeige emerges from inside the guardhouse near the gate, a sizable crate in his arms.\n\n\"My Liege, the quartermaster has identified another box of equipment. Since our available troops are dwindling due to injuries, this will prove useful. Another ingenious invention of one of the mage apprentices: Pop-Up Walls. They are magical barriers that can be set up quickly in the battlefield. They explode when an enemy touches them!\"\n\nThe High General stuffs several of the shimmering flasks into a cloth bag and hands it to you as you mount your horse. You quickly ride out to the West Road, your troops behind you.",
