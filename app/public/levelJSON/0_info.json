  "storyline" : "All is quiet and serene in your kingdom of Wisteria, but a sudden feeling of foreboding fills the air. Your military adviser, High General Norbert McBeige, bursts into the room.\n\n\"My Liege, we have received troubling reports from the countryside! An unidentified enemy has been attacking our villages and leaving them emptied of life,\" he briefs you.\n\n\"The pattern of attacks has led us to believe that this enemy is heading straight toward Wisteria Castle. As the heart of our kingdom, it must be protected at all costs!\" he declares.\n\nYou silently ponder this. There has been peace in this kingdom for a long time. The last time your kingdom was at war was early during the reign of your grandmother, Agatha the Warrior Queen.\n\nYou wonder where your Chief Advisor is at a time like this, for you are sorely lacking the counsel of the great Razy DaZel, high mage of the kingdom.\n\nJust as you think this, a loud explosion rocks the castle, and you hear several east-facing windows shatter. No doubt this came from Magus DaZel's laboratory. Was this planned?\n\nYou have no time left to consider this, as you hear the warhorn sound at the gates. They are coming, and you must defend your kingdom.",
