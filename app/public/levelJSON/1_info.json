  "storyline" : "You manage to beat back the surprise attackers, and regroup with your High General.\n\n\"Excellent work, My Liege! You've saved us once again. I fear, however, that we haven't seen the last of them. The attackers seemed to be wearing the attire of forest robbers. It is unthinkable why they would choose to attack the castle.\"\n\nYou ask him the whereabouts of your Chief Adviser, Magus DaZel.\n\n\"We're not sure, My Liege. The explosion you heard earlier indeed seemed to originate in his tower. I have sent a page to investigate.\"\n\nYou think back to the stories your uncle told you about the Great, Wise, and Powerful Razy DaZel, and how he defeated and turned away the only known living dragon just before you were born. You assume his magic would make short work of a few paltry invading thieves.\n\nA second blast from the warhorn alerts you to a new attack. You prepare to face them again.",
