11: A Quick Reprieve
You watch as the last of the slime enemies are beaten away from the bridge. Your troops cheer and you return to the castle. As you enter the gates, you see a haggard old woman just inside. She has her one good eye on you, and speaks to you in a voice that sounds as creaky as she looks.

"Our esteemed ruler, I thank you for saving our skins. I am Morgantha. They call me the sage of Northfork. Usually, of course, they call me 'Old Morgantha.'" Her cackle is so shrill, you are sure the windows nearby will shatter.

"I am guessing that you don't know anything about these creatures that are attacking. Luckily, I am old enough to have heard something about them. There is much you must know."

Scoutmaster Tara and High General McBeige approach the two of you. It is resolved that the scouts will return to the field this night to watch over the roads and observe enemy movements. The High General informs you that more of the outer patrols have returned to the castle, though not all of them.

You head to your quarters and lie down to get what little rest you can. Somehow, the night passes without incident. In the morning, a few straggling slime-monsters have wandered into the battlefield, giving you an excellent opportunity to try out more of that magic weapon McBeige gave you yesterday.


12: Along the East Road
"I see you have mastered the use of the Revolving Shield. A nice little toy that will come in handy for you, I'm sure," Morgantha says. She was waiting for you in the staging area behind the gate.

"The enemy you are fighting is called the Green Slime. Yes, yes, very original. I know," she says, giving you a snaggle-toothed grin. "But here is what you may not know: those who come into direct contact with the Slime fall victim to its control!"

So those weren't traitors who attacked you in Wisteria uniforms. McBeige would be relieved to hear that.

High General McBeige approaches and salutes you. He reports that slime creatures have been spotted to the east, so that is where the first excursion will be headed. He has put a small group of soldiers together, and you ride out in search of answers.


13: The East Tower
When you return to the castle, Morgantha is waiting with more information.

"The Slime seemed to first emerge shortly after the disappearance of your mother, the Crown-Princess Imogen. At the time, some people thought that the two were related. In fact, your father, Royal Consort Frederick, was so convinced that he took a search party out to look for her. And then he disappeared, too."

"It seems that the Slime particularly likes the taste of your family. You ought to be careful out there, your Royal Highness," she cackles at you.

After a fruitless search, you awaken the next morning and set off to clear Slime out of the next area.


14: Deserted Monastery
After your return, Morgantha tells you a little about the mother you lost when you had not yet seen four winters.

"Aye, she was a restless thing, your mother. Princess Imogen always wanted to see more of the world. She wanted to crawl through every cave and climb every mountain. She came to visit me often to hear my teachings of herbs and potions."

Morgantha continues speaking highly of your mother. The next morning, you set off with more troops and more provisions, aiming to reach the village of Easthaven before dark. You first come across a deserted monastery...
