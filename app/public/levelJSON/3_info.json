  "storyline" : "It is nightfall as you enter the keep with your High General. You spend the next several hours poring over the strategic map of your kingdom and its regions. A runner brings you periodic status updates from outdoors, but it seems that everything is quiet for now.\n\nAfter what seems like countless hours of talking strategy, your High General advises you to get some rest. The attacks are not likely to let up tomorrow.\n\nHe also informs you that no one has yet heard from Magus DaZel. There seems to be a magical ward in place as a barrier at the door to his tower, and no one can get inside.\n\nYou head to your quarters and lie down to get some rest. It seems that you had only shut your eyes for a moment before a servant bursts into your room. They hurriedly inform you that scouts have spotted the invaders mustering for a nocturnal surprise attack.",
